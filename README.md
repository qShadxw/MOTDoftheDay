MOTDs have been MOTFs (Message of the Forevers) since well... forever. This mod allows you to change your MOTD in a configurable interval and randomly from a list of strings which you can also configure!

Open-Sourced, Feel free to use any of the code within your own projects if wanted.
You're allowed to use this mod in side of your own modpack, no need to ask.
